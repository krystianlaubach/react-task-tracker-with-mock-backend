# React Task Tracker with Mock Backend

I am not an author of this app. I have created it for learning purpose based on the [React JS Crash Course 2021](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8) with small amendments.

Original repository [Task Tracker App](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react-crash-2021).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To mock backend project uses [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

I have also used [React Date Picker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker) component and  [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library.
